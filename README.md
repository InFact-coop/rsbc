## The Challenge

>Help professionals to refer families with vision impairment to RSBC

> Jane (a SENDCO) needs a way to understand how to support VI children in their care within education so that they can feel equipped with the knowledge/skils/resources to support


## Our Solution?

Our solution aims to deal more specifically with the second challenge above, which hopefully will go someway to dealing with the initial, first challenge.

We have developed a prototype app that SENDCO's can use to find quickly find resources and services for their VI students.

 **The aims of the solution**

- To support the existing but variable provisions from local authorities with appropriate information and referrals
- Help SENDCO's easily and quickly find resources
- Allow SENDCO's to see what others think of the resources
- Give SENDCO's more information about RSBC
- Give SENDCO's a way to submit information to RSBC for RSBC to use


### Process 

__User Stories__
We began by aligning on the main user stories that were key to the success of the prototype. There were:

> As a SENDCO I want to: 

- [x] easily find the answer to my questions so I can provide the best support for my vision impaired student and their families.
- [x] easily access the subject area relevant to the child I am supporting so that I can provide personalised expert support
- [x] know what services are available in my area so I can recommend them to the student and their family.
- [x]  be able to share this information with the student/family so I can provide immediate practical help.
- [x] know what RSBC can do in helping me support the student/family so I can provide more support to more students in my working day.
- [x] able to provide feedback on the quality of information RSBC's provides so I feel my experience is taken into account.
- [ ] be able to trust the information so I feel confident that it will make a difference to my VI child
> As RSBC I want to 
- [x] know how many families we have helped so that we can report on our progress towards the 11,000 families helped by 2020



__Design__  
  
We started by building designs in Figma to help map the user journey more thoroughly.

With Samantha's help and feedback, we refined the designs to adapt it to SENDCO's needs and branding.

As a result, we can present you with this prototype, which is not a functional app but a proof of concept. 

Once tested, we will be able to build a functional app, designed to satisfy the user needs.


## Further Development
### User Testing
User testing allows you to get feedback from your primary users to check that the product being built fits their needs. This is __very__ important to build a successful product. 

The three key points for testing are:
- Have a script which has tasks for them to complete
- Ask for people to give you a commentry of what they are doing, but don't response to them
- Document their response

Here are some useful resources to look at when completing your user testing sessions:
- [Googles Gurilla Testing Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YL0xoSmyZI&feature=youtu.be)
- [Script Guidance and Template](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/user-testing.md#1-planning)

Recommendations for user testing:

- Large relatively shallow application at the moment
- Lots of different features - finding resources, finding out what's near me, sharing information with RSBC.
- It would be essential to get feedback about what feautures the users (SENDCOs) think are most relevant to them. 
- In addition to this, if any feautures are thought to be irrelevant or confusing, it would be good to take this into account.
- Also, feedback on the design would be important.

### Next Sprint
If this design is move forward for a build sprint it is important to concentrate on key features that both solves the initital problem and implements feedback from user testing.

Our current recommendation for initial features would be:
  - Focusing on whatever feature the user-testing feedback tells us is most useful. Further features would be implemented in further sprints
  - If the resource finding "feature" is seen as more important, then a database of resources would be needed. Adding a way for SENDCO's to submit resources would be an interesting feature
  - This could help solve the final user story.
  - What might be more feasible is focusing on the "Near Me" feature (if SENDCO's see it as useful). If a database of events/services already exist, then a much more refined app which locates a user and shows nearby services could maybe be developed
  - Another option is developing the "Us & You" section. The information about RSBC could be more dynamic, and the data could actually submit to RSBC and give some feedback to the user (maybe how close the target RSBC are)
